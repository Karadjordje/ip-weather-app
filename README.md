# Task 2
## ip-weather-app

This app won't work on gh-pages because both api-s used require payed version of api for https and gh-pages force https.

# Task 1
## Responsive suggestion
### Top bar part:
- On tablets I would put left side above right. On mobile devices I would hide left part as it is not necessary for UX and would put search input and button into two separate rows.
Dashboard part:
### Dashboard main menu:<br> 
- On tablets I would keep it as it is and for mobile devices I would create burger menu.
### Dashboard side menu:<br> 
- On both tablets and mobile devices I would put it above content and give it  tab like look.
### Content:<br>
- Because now we have dashboard side menu above it and we can use whole width of screen I would keep layout inside of it as it is.
- For mobile devices I would use smaller fonts so user doesn't have to scroll a lot. I would also remove `10 children` text and put number of children inside brackets beside `show children` link.
